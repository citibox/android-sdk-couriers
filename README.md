# Courier SDK for integration

This library allows third parties to use Citibox Services for Couriers.  
Works with Courier app installed or via web view

## Content üìã

Library and example of how to integrate with Cibitox services for deliveries

## Requirements üëÄ

Contact our partners at Citibox to get your ACCESS TOKEN

It's recommended to have Couriers App installed to get all the features and maybe the best user
experience

If no Couriers App is installed, this SDK will show you the web app version with all the features
needed in order to deliver your parcels

        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }

What are they? They are separated environments and endpoints where you operate, these are:
production, sandbox, local and test. Each one has it's own DB and admin panel.
